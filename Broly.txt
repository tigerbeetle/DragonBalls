Broly is also known as the legendary super saiyan. He was born with a power level of 10000 which made King Vegeta suspect that one day he might get so powerful that he might overthrow him from the throne.
Because of this doubt, he ordered Broly to be executed. However Broly being extremely powerly managed to escape death. On the same day planet Vegeta was destroyed.
