Vegeta (a.k.a prince Vegeta) is the son of King Vegeta. He is the prince of all Saiyan. After planet vegeta was destroyed, he started looking for all Saiyans who were alive. Doing so, he came to planet Earth.
When he came to planet Earth, he found that Goku has become an ally of planet Earth. That's when the rivalry between vegeta and goku started.
